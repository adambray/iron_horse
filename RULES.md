Game: Iron Horse

==Elements==

* 1 Game Board (consisting of cities connected by routes)
* ? Worker pieces (? for each player)
* ? Resource Cards
* ? Factory pieces
* ? Resource pieces

Objective
=========

Much like TtR, the game is played on a board that consists of cities joined by routes. The goal is to score the most points. Points can be scored in the following ways:

* Building routes connecting nearby cities (variable)
* Building the longest continuous path starting from your home city (10 points)
* Building a route to any of your opponents' home cities (10 points each)

Gameplay
========

At the beginning of the game, players take turns picking a 'home' city, and are given a fixed number of worker pieces (much like trains in TtR). Players combine those workers with resource cards (fuel, iron, wood, dynamite, and stone) to build routes. 

Whereas TtR's routes vary by 'distance', in Iron Horse, each route requires a certain number of workers and various resource cards to build on it. For example, the route connecting Las Vegas to Salt Lake may require 3 workers, 2 iron, 1 fuel, and 3 wood. Each route is also assigned a point value; players receive those points upon building that route.

Building Routes
===============

To build a route, a player uses a turn. The player combines the designated number of workers and resource cards, and claims the route. Players may only claim one route per turn, and must claim an entire route (they cannot 'hold' a route by playing part of the resources required.) 

Each route may only be claimed by one player.

Resources
=========

Players may collect resource cards in two ways:
* by drawing two cards from the deck of resource cards (either from the top of the face-down pile, or from any of the five face-up cards, or one of each)
* by building a factory in their home city and later using up a worker piece to 'deliver' the resources to their general collection

Factories
=========

Each factory can generate only one type of resource. Each player is allowed up to three factories in their home city. To build a factory, a player spends one turn and three workers. At the beginning of every turn (starting on the turn after a factory is built), each factory generates one unit  of its designated resource per turn, to be stored in the home city (by placing a corresponding resource piece nearby). At the end of every turn, a player may store no more than 6 units of resources (in total, of any combination).

On a given turn, a player may choose to spend up to three workers to 'deliver' resources (one unit per worker) stored in their home city to any city reachable by rail. Those resources may then be used in a later turn to build a route connecting that city with another (factory resources may be used in addition to resource cards for the purpose of building routes).

Turns
=====

Players take turns performing one of four actions:
* Using workers and resources to build a route
* Drawing resource cards from from the deck
* Building a factory on their home city
* Moving resources built by their factories to routes

End of play
===========

The game ends when any player has ends a turn with two or fewer workers. Each player (including the aforementioned player) gets one more turn.

At the end of play, players add up the total points earned for building routes and any bonuses.
